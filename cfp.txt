# DESCRIPTION
A knowledge graph is any graph-based knowledge base, which represents a large network of 
entities, their semantic types (e.g. a Person or an Organisation), properties (e.g. the 
name and birth date of a person), and relationships between entities such as a person 
working in an organisation. Academic research communities, as well as industrial 
stakeholders, have constructed a number of large-scale knowledge graphs in recent years 
such as DBpedia, YAGO, Freebase, Wikidata, Google Knowledge Graph, Microsoft Satori, 
Facebook Entity Graph, Yahoo! Knowledge Graph and others. They are intensively used in 
different application scenarios such as search, question answering, natural language 
processing, data integration and analytics, and for specialised areas such as digital 
humanities, business, life science and more.

However, due to the diversity of data sources and limitations of present knowledge 
extraction methods, most knowledge graphs face a variety of quality issues such as noise 
and vague data, inconsistency, inaccurate and out-of-date data, incomplete information, 
and poor interlinking between KGs. To facilitate wide adoption and advanced usage, it is 
crucial to ensure the quality of knowledge graphs.

There are still big gaps between present state of quality engineering techniques and high 
quality KGs and their effective applications. Therefore, this workshop aims to address 
not only the challenges and state-of-the-art solutions in quality assessment and 
improvement for knowledge graphs, but also challenges for effectively employing reliable 
KGs in different domains.

QEKGraph welcomes original research contributions crossing Data Quality and knowledge 
graph management and consumption. Scholars who have conducted research or developed 
impactful applications are invited to submit full papers with appropriately evaluated 
contributions. QEKGraph also welcomes vision/position papers on novel challenges or 
approaches to existing problems (short papers). Topics on which potential submitters are 
invited to contribute include, but are not limited to:

- Quality issues in knowledge graphs
- Quality assessment metrics and measures
- Representation of quality assessment results
- Data cleaning and knowledge graphs
- Outlier detection in knowledge graphs
- Triple classification and ranking
- Trust and provenance of knowledge graphs
- Data integration and quality control
- Evaluation of quality of links in the Web of Data
- Evaluation of link prediction methods
- Evaluation benchmark and datasets
- Multilingual knowledge graphs and quality control
- Quality assessment at scale
- Crowdsourcing and knowledge graph quality
- Quality of specialised knowledge graphs
- Trust and reliability of digital humanities and social science data
- Advancing education with data quality engineering

Submissions in all the categories mentioned above (full or short papers) will be 
peer-reviewed by acknowledged researchers familiar with both scientific communities. 
Accepted papers will be published as online proceedings courtesy of CEUR-WS.org.
